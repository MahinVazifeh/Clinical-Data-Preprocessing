# ðŸ§ª Clinical Data Processing

This repository offers a structured collection of **Jupyter notebooks** designed for comprehensive **clinical data processing**. Its functionalities encompass:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw clinical data for analysis.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creating new, informative features from existing data to enhance model performance.
* **Quality Control**: Implementing checks and procedures to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

The tools within this repository are specifically tailored for **longitudinal data analysis**, with a particular emphasis on **disease progression modeling**. A prime example of its application is in understanding and predicting the progression of diseases like **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project includes a modular pipeline for:

* **ðŸ§¬ Selecting and generating important clinical features**
* **ðŸ§¹ Cleaning data and removing outliers**
* **ðŸ“… Extracting time-based features**
* **ðŸ“ˆ Tracking clinical progression metrics** (e.g., MSSS)
* **ðŸŽ¯ Normalizing scores and rounding values**
* **âœ… Ensuring data quality and consistency**

Each notebook is designed to work independently or as part of a full pipeline.
